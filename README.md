Coding Projects that Help me learned Fundamentals and Concepts in coding

1. Bash Name & Numbers
   - The code captures user input and presents it for display.

2. Coin Toss Simulator
   -  This program offers a straightforward coin-tossing simulation while also showcasing practical implementations of file handling and user interaction.

3. Embedded Systems Code
   - This folder contains code I wrote to deepen my understanding of Embedded Systems programming.

5. GPA Tracker (Windows)
   - This code captures user input regarding a student and subsequently presents the information

6. Popular Name Checker
   - This program reads a list of names from two text files and stores them in an array. It prompts the user to input a name they want to check for popularity during the year 2000. The program then searches the array to determine if the provided name was popular during that year.

7. Ships
   - This Java code simulates the management of various types of ships, including normal ships, cruise ships, cargo ships, and destroyer ships. It prompts the user to input information such as the ship's name, year built, and specific attributes like maximum capacity or weapon count. Subsequently, it displays the entered ship details and gives the option to activate the weapons system for destroyer ships. The program employs an ArrayList to store the ship objects and utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to handle different ship types. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of object-oriented concepts like classes, objects, and method invocation.

8. Tile Room Price Checker
   - This program prompts the user to input the name of a room, its dimensions, and the price per tile. Subsequently, it computes the total cost of flooring for the specified room based on these inputs.

9. Understanding how classes work in Java
   - This code defines two classes tailored for classifying students and managing their gradebook data.
